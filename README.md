# Fake-Product-Identification-System-using-Blockchain

We proposed a fake product detection system using blockchain technology for the detection of counterfeit products. The proposed system ensures that the detection of fake products in day-to-day life. The proposed system consists of three main phases- Product registration, Check product and Blockchain network. 

	The first phase – Manufacturer Login - is all about the registration of the product details – Batch no./Product no. of the product and name of the product.

	A second phase – Customer/User login is to check if the product is counterfeit or not, by searching for the batch number of the product then it shows that the product is fake or real. 


In the proposed system, a unique hash code is generated for a particular product after it is registered and the data gets stored in the database. After searching for the batch number of a product, we get the result of the product is real or fake. In the end, the Blockchain system can be checked if it is tampered or not by calling the isValid() function.
